# About Me

G'day, and welcome to my blog. I'm Riley, a 17 year old high school student and CTF player from Perth, Australia. I captain the team PissedEmu, and specialise in pwn and crypto challenges.

In this blog, you'll see my CTF writeups as well as any interesting research I do. I hope you enjoy reading my ramblings :)
